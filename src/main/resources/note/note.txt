using purge messages we can clear message queue

consumer deals with queue not with exchange

Exchange types :
    1. Direct Exchange
    2. Fanout Exchange
    3. Topic Exchange
    4. Headers Exchange

1. Direct Exchange
pass message to relevant queue after checking key

2. Fanout Exchange
their is no key like direct exchange
producer will pass message to each queue those are bound with it
for fanout exchange we not add routing key

3. Topic Exchange
in this has key combining words by . symbol
key example : tv.mobile.ac
* means one word
# means one or more word

4. Headers Exchange
It is look like hashmap in java
x-match=any
    means or condition key can be any mentioned one
x-match=all
    means and condition
there is no routing key we use headers


fanout exchange follows publish subscribe mythology.
direct exchange follows direct key mythology
headers exchange does NOT deal with routing keys



when we upload jar to spring cloud we do not need to add properties to application.property file
because spring cloud automatically setup those using binded services
application.property need s when we upload our jar to pivotal cloud

if we deploy war file we need to bind java build pack github url with -b
eg: cf push app-name -p file-location -b cloud-fondary-java-buildpack-github-link
